\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the many individuals who have supported me throughout my doctoral journey.

First and foremost, I extend my deepest appreciation to my supervisors, Prof. Ali Zemouche, Prof. Rafaralahy, and Dr. Madjid Haddad, for granting me the opportunity to pursue this research. 
I am profoundly grateful for their continuous guidance, encouragement, and trust. 
Their insightful advice, valuable discussions, and unwavering support both scientific and personalhave been essential to the completion of this dissertation. Without their mentorship, this work would not have reached its present form.

I am also extremely grateful to my colleaguesHasni, Shengya, Echrak, Hichem, Oussama, Sesabil, Tansuh, Siyu, Viet, Melissa, and Li Qifor their cooperation, constructive feedback, and camaraderie throughout my PhD studies. From my first day in the laboratory to my first scientific publication, they were always willing to offer help. I particularly appreciate their patience and understanding when I took on my first leadership role during a team project. Despite my limited experience, they supported me with tolerance and encouragement rather than faulting my mistakes, allowing me to grow both professionally and personally.

Similarly, during my first teaching experiences, I faced significant challenges overcoming shyness and the difficulty of teaching in French, which is not my native language. The continuous support of my colleagues played a crucial role in helping me surmount these obstacles and build my confidence.

Last but not least, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my familymy uncle and aunt, my parents, and my girlfriendfor their unconditional love, patience, and support. I am especially thankful to my uncle and aunt, who have provided unwavering financial and spiritual support throughout my entire academic journey. Their encouragement and sacrifices have been a constant source of motivation, contributing significantly to my pursuit of higher academic achievements.
